# Javascript-Challenge
hw for java

Here is my homework submission of the javascript challenge

for Level 1 I was able to have it show the data properly filtered on the date given by the user. 

as long as you put a valid date in the search box it will populate the table with the UFO data on that date.

the search text box will clear itself

then you can try to run another date.

------

for Level 2 I was able to add a second filter criteria

this is by the city chosen.

nothing will populate on screen just by inputting the date.

after you input a date, select filter. open your console and you will see a list of cities you can choose to find your desired data. - the list of cities are all from the date chosen

with the date still in the first search box, populate the second search box with any city from the list and you will see the output filtered on both pieces of data.

feel free to replace that city with another city still listed below and it will change

thank you!

have a good week/weekend.
