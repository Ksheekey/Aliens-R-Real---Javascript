# Javascript-Challenge

Here we are tasked with a UFO sighting dataset. The goal is to have a properly working table when a date is chosen. The table will filter the UFO sightings that match the date.

Date range is from 1/1 - 1/13 of 2010

Feel free to filter on a different date, the table will reset with the new date chosen
